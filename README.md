# Expected Goals Model
- this is to present my attempt in modelling the most well known statistics in Football/Soccer Analytics community - Expected Goals
- logistic regression is applied to model the probabilities of scoring a goal dependent on a chance's characteristics
- covariates of the resulting model includes: shot quality, defensive pressure, number of Defensive Players in a DIRECT line of goal from the shooting player, game state, type of attack as well as distance and angle (the latter two are transformed using restricted cubic splines)
